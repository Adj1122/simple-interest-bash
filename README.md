# Simple Interest Calculator (Bash)

A tiny Bash utility to compute **Simple Interest (SI)** using the formula:

> **SI = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**

## Usage

```bash
./simple-interest.sh <principal> <annual_rate_percent> <time_in_years>

./simple-interest.sh 10000 7.5 2
# Output:
# Principal : 10000
# Rate      : 7.5%
# Time      : 2 years
# Simple Interest: 1500.00
# Total Amount   : 11500.00

## 5) Preview (optional but recommended)
1. Above the editor, click the **Preview** tab to see how it will look once saved.  
2. Verify code blocks, headings, and examples look right.

---

## 6) Commit the file (save it)
1. Scroll down to **Commit new file** section below the editor.  
2. In **Commit message** type:  
3. Choose commit option:
- **Commit directly to the `main` branch** → quick and simple (choose this if you want the file immediately in the repo and you’re not working in a team).
- OR **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request** → choose this if you want to review changes before merging.
4. Click the **Commit new file** button (green).

---

## 7) Verify the file is in the repo root
1. After commit, you’ll be redirected to the repository file list.  
2. You should see `README.md` in the list. GitHub will also render it underneath the file list on the repo home page.

## 8) Checklist to satisfy the rubric / common mistakes
- ✅ File name is `README.md` (not `Readme` or `README` without `.md`).  
- ✅ README includes: project title, short description, usage instructions, example output, and list of repo files.  
- ❌ Don’t leave it empty — add real content (the copy above is enough).  
- Make sure the repo is **Public** so graders can read it.

## 9) How to edit later (if you need to fix something)
1. Open `README.md` in the repo file list.  
2. Click the pencil icon **Edit this file** (top-right).  
3. Make changes, preview, then commit the change with a message like `Fix README typos`.

If you want, I can give you a slightly shorter README variant for strict-scoring rubrics, or show exactly what to write for the commit message and branch name if you prefer using a branch workflow. Want me to paste that trimmed README too?
